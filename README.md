# Meeting-Internship-Test
To code is running on Java Spring Boot. 
The file for starting the code is found with this directory Meeting-Internship-Test/Meeting-Internship-Test/src/main/java/com/vismaInternshipTest/MeetingInternshipTest/MeetingInternshipTestApplication.java
Everything in Meeting-Internship-Test/Meeting-Internship-Test/src/test/java/com/vismaInternshipTest is older forms of file that could be used to modifying the code and upgrading
the code but in my case scratched as they didn't worked, partially worked, or where just too simple to kept

All the password information is stored in meetings.json and is now fully cleared out without any examples, but data in it should look like this:
{"employees":[{"name":"Chas","id":"EMP986817","responsiblePerson":"Chas","description":"Likes to Chill","category":"Hub","type":"InPerson","startDate":"2022-11-12","endDate":"2023-05-29"}, {...}]}
